# WhatsApp Chat Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of WhatsApp chat data for various data science tasks, including sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, named entity recognition, and other natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By analyzing WhatsApp messages, you can derive valuable insights and potentially solve business problems.

## Key Objectives:
### Load WhatsApp Chat Data:
Extract chat data from your WhatsApp application and load it into the Python environment.

### Preprocess Text Data:
Define functions and methods to preprocess the chat text data.

### Clean Text Data: 
Incorporate NLP techniques for cleaning the text data.

### Generate Word Clouds:
Create word clouds of the processed chat data.

### Save Word Cloud Images: 
Save the images of word clouds to your system.

### Perform Sentiment Analysis: 
Extract information through sentiment analysis.

## 1. Downloading the Data from WhatsApp
Follow the instructions to export the chat data from WhatsApp.
Save the exported chat file (usually a .txt file) to your local system.

## 2. Loading the Chat Data into Python
Read the .txt file into Python using appropriate libraries such as pandas or built-in file handling methods.

## 3. Preprocessing the Text Data
Define functions to clean and preprocess the text data.
Tasks include removing timestamps, usernames, special characters, and handling emojis.

## 4. Incorporating NLP Techniques for Cleaning the Text Data
Further clean the data using NLP techniques.
Remove stopwords, perform stemming or lemmatization, and tokenize the text.

## 5. Creating Word Clouds of the Processed Chat Data
Generate word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in the chat data.
Save the word cloud images to your system.

## 6. Extracting Information Through Sentiment Analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on the chat data to understand the overall sentiment.
Use libraries like TextBlob, VADER, or NLTK for sentiment analysis.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Extract WhatsApp Chat Data**:
   - Export chat data from WhatsApp and save it in the `content` directory.

2. **Environment Setup**:
